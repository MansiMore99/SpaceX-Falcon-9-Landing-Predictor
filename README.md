##### üéâ Labs completed by Mansi More

I worked on the SpaceX Falcon 9 Landing Prediction Project, utilizing web scraping with BeautifulSoup to gather and preprocess launch data. I conducted in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) and feature engineering using Python and Matplotlib. I implemented SVM, Classification Trees, and Logistic Regression models, optimizing hyperparameters to achieve a 6% increase in accuracy for Decision Tree models. I have demonstrated expertise in data science methodologies and advanced machine learning techniques for predicting SpaceX Falcon 9 first-stage landing outcomes.

### üìö Extra Study Materials
Dont jump into labs without study. Take time to study previous labs step by step and also practice on your own laptop locally by installing Anaconda. This will also limit the usage of IBM Cloud Trial version.

 ###### Plotly: https://github.com/plotly
